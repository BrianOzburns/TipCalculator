# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Brian Ozawa Burns**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Implemented slider in place of segment control bar (with only integer percent values)
- Implemented decimal number pad
- Implemented useless settings screen (wanted to have IUSwitch to change the color gradient of the main screen's background but spent hours of time I really couldn't afford to have lost at the moment so I gave up :)

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

- I'm a second-quarter cs student and only have been exposed to python and C++ (I actually felt that swift looked like a combination of the two), but anyway I have zero experience with swift so most of my code is from outside sources.
- One particular issue I had was trying to connect my IUSwitch on the settings screen to the gradient background of the main screen. I spent hours trying to figure out how to do this but had little success.
